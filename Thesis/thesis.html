        <div class= "Thesis-content">
          <p style="text-align:left"> The present study investigated the role of emotional compared to political involvement in the polarization of attitudes outlined by the cusp. Attitudes were thus modeled as a dynamic system consisting of sudden and non-linear interactions. A sample of Twitter posts (n = 4000) was evaluated using domain-specific lexicons. Users' lexicon means (n = 2891) were encoded as the cusp's dependent (AFINN lexicon) and involvement (Political or NRC Af-fect Intensity lexicons) variables. Fitting the cusp depended on restriction tests and in-volvement types, resulting in restricted and unrestricted political and emotional models. All cusp models fitted better than linear models. Likewise, the restricted emotional and unre-stricted political models fitted the best. In line with the hypothesis, both elevated involve-ment types resulted in attitude polarization. Political involvement demonstrated more such polarization. Unexpectedly, emotional involvement was overall high and political involve-ment correlated with attitudes. The use of lexicons and Twitter data is therefore discussed.
