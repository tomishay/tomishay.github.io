        <div class= "post-content">
          <p> Animals have long been used in psychological research as models for human behavior. However, the scientific community deems animals to have a degraded or even lack consciousness compared to humans. In this paper, I provide a logical analysis of consciousness in animal models.</p>

        <div class= "post-content">
          <p>"I think, therefore I am" - Rene Descartes.

Once stated by one of the most influential philosophers in the history, Descartes, the only certain undoubted property is the doubting soul itself. Descartes concludes that the human soul is an immaterial entity, detached from the physical world. Thereby the wise philosopher stumbled upon a problem that remains unsolved - the problem of mind and body, the interactive relationship between the mind and the body or more specifically, the brain.</p>

        <div class= "post-content">
          <p>The experience of cancer may feel as mental as it is physical. Is it only a feeling or is our mind able to influence the chance of developing a chronic and prevalent disease like cancer? This may seem like an absurd idea, involving mental superpowers, however, research might suggest differently. This raises the question of the influence of mentality in the initiation and progression (development) of cancer.</p>

          <p>Network models are on the rise in the psychological modeling of clinical data. In this paper, I critically review the validity of such networks in modeling causal relationships between symptoms on the individual level.</p>
